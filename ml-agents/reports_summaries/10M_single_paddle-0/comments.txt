No significant improvements until 1.5M iterations. Was originally trained until 1M iterations, where it started
showing signs of improvement. In this run the game was reset every time the paddle managed to hit the ball or
the ball went into the goal. Almost reached "perfection" after 10M runs as the reward for hitting the ball
each time was set to 0.1
